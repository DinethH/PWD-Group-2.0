            <p>PWD Group, Inc is a Minority Owned, Historically Underutilized Business that has multiple interests. These interest are Consulting, Publications, Technology, Certification, and Real Estate. </p>
            
            <h2>Consulting</h2>
            
            <p>
Consulting includes transportation logistics planning, operations and facility planning, and efficient inventory control policies that minimize inventory holding costs. Consulting also include evaluation of software systems and automation technologies that support the aforementioned planning. Specifically evaluation of the usefulness of Automatic Data Capture (ADC) technologies, which includes Bar-code and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies. These technologies are used to improve operations in industries such as health care and hospital organizations, inter-modal (port, pipelines, rail, and tractor/trailer) operations, and distribution (warehouse, manufacturing plant, and distribution center) operations. The firm focuses upon industrial engineering tools, techniques and tactics which include Six Sigma variability reduction methodologies and project management, Human Factors & Ergonomics based work measurement and time studies, System based risk evaluation and thinking, Operations Research based modeling, and customer focused process improvement</p>
            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p>Our publication branch focuses getting your idea on to the bookshelf. We mainly focus on books that are helpful for certifications such as Six Sigma and RFID certification. The main reason for doing so is that the reader would feel more connected if the terminology is in a more readable form rather than a point by point form. We hope to expand our focus to include other teachings such as warehousing and real-estate. 

</p>
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>We as a research and technology company, conduct product testing and development on different technology. Our current focus is on the field of RFID technology and its implementation. We are also a registered re-seller for many of the RFID technology we work with. Our employees have been trained to evaluate and install RFID technology, given a situation. Each installation differs from one another according to the requirements of the project. The technology itself has different uses and requirements. Therefore we conduct a thorough analysis of the facility and the process before installing the technology.
</p>
            <h2>Certification</h2>
            <p>
After receiving your standard education, one of the only means of defining yourself and having an edge is by completing certification programs. We are a certified by ISCEA, an international certification body, to conduct training on the different programs they offer. The material we provide have been evaluated and certified for teaching. We have a database of international trainer we can provide to conduct training at a given date and location. However in order for us to send a trainer, certain criteria must be met. Once the training is completed and the individual has completed the exam, they would receive a proof of certification from ISCEA
